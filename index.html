 <p>This website is here to teach you how to set up and run your own minecraft server, both vanilla and modded! <br> This will also provide resources on how to port forward, what the recommended hardware is, and even help you configure your server configurations!</p>

 <h3>Where do I begin?</h3>
 <p>The fated question! This is always the hardest part for a beginner. How <i>do</i> you install the necessary programs for a server? <br>Its actually rather simple! Generally, you should go to the official website for the .jar file necessary to run it. There are special cases, which we will get into later, but we will do the basics first.</p> 
 <h4><a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server" target="_blank">Here is the link to the official Minecraft.net website to download the server.</a></h4>
 <p>On this website, there is a download link. At the time of writing, the version is 1.21.5. This is the latest version of Minecraft, and the one you want the most. <br>Then, you want to put it into its own folder (I recommend placing this folder on the desktop, personally) and run the server.jar file you downloaded.</p>
 <h3>A bunch of files appeared and my server failed!</h3>
<p>No need to panic yet! This part is simple. One of the files that appeared in your new folder is a txt file called EULA. <br>This is the End User License Agreement for Minecraft, and all you have to do is click into this text file and change the false to true. This means you agree to Minecrafts End User License Agreement.</p>
<p>Now you have all you need to start up your server. But first, we should get into some more technical stuff that you need to know before your friends can play.</p>
<h4><a href="table.html">Here is the system requirements page!</a></h4>
<p>With that done, we can start our Minecraft Server for the first time. Just start up the server.jar file again, and it will generate the world and start the server! <br>Now, if your friends are all local with you, great! Your good to go! But most likely, your friends are away from your local network. This means you will have to Port Forward your router. I have provided a youtube link here to learn more, as its rather complicated.</p>
